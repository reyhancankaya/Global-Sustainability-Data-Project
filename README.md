# Global-Sustainability-Data-Project
An end-to-end data analytics project that explores corporate carbon footprints, renewable energy adoption, and projected fiscal tax liabilities using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Tableau**.
## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a full data pipeline, from raw data generation and cleaning to high-level executive dashboarding. It aims to help sustainability officers identify high-emission facilities and calculate potential financial risks due to carbon taxation.

## Tech Stack & Workflow
1.  **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Used for synthetic data generation, data cleaning (handling missing values), and creating calculated fields for sustainability metrics.
2.  **Excel:** Acted as a structured data warehouse to store the processed dataset.
3.  **Tableau:** Developed an interactive dashboard to visualize geographical emission hotspots and financial KPIs.

## Key Features & KPIs
- **Global Emission Map:** Heatmap showing carbon emissions by region (APAC, Europe, North America, LATAM).
- **Financial Impact Tracking:** Real-time calculation of total carbon tax costs based on regional tax rates.
- **Factory Efficiency Analysis:** A bar chart comparing emission levels across different factory types (Manufacturing, Warehouse, etc.).
- **Sustainability Scorecard:** Tracking the average Renewable Energy Ratio (%) across all operations.
